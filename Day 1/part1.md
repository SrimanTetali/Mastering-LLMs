The provided virtual representation illustrates how these terms fit into
a hierarchy.

In summary,

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is about making machines think and
behave like humans.

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a part of AI that teaches computers to
learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly
programmed.

**Neural Networks (NNs)**, a subset of ML, mimic the human brain\'s
structure and are crucial in deep learning algorithms.

**Deep Learning (DL)** is great for solving complex problems, such as
recognizing images or translating languages.

**Generative AI (GenAI),** a subset of DL, can create all sorts of
content based on what it has learned.

**Large Language Models (LLM)**, a subset of generative AI, specialize
in generating human-like text by learning from extensive textual data.

Gen AI and LLMs has transformed the AI machines to produce content like
images, audios, videos, music and text. Gen AI models generates new
content from the human created datasets, unlike other models that
classify. Foundation models of Gen AI are capable of multi-tasking like
summarization, Q&A and classification with minimal training and data,
adapting to various use cases effectively. Example of such a model is
ChatGPT.

Generative AI learns through supervised learning, where it\'s fed
human-made content with labels. By studying this data, the model gets
good at creating similar content to training data. Generative AI is not a new idea. A classic example of early Gen AI is
the Markov chain, invented by Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in
1906. These models were first used for things like predicting the next
word in a sentence. But they were too simple to make text that sounded
real.

The field of AI has changed over years with powerful architectures and
large datasets.

- In 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) came about. They work
with two models---one creating output and the other deciding if it\'s
real or fake. This made generated content much more realistic, like with
models such as StyleGAN.

- Then, in 2015, diffusion models showed up. They keep improving their
output to make new data that looks like what they were trained on. This
made it possible to create more realistic images, like with Stable
Diffusion.

- In 2017, Google introduced transformers. These encode each word in a
text and make a map of how they relate to each other. This helps the
model make sense in generating text, like with ChatGPT. The boom in
generative AI isn\'t just because we have more data. It\'s also thanks
to different new methods like GANs, diffusion models, and transformers,
all adding excitement of the field.

# **Large Language Models (LLMs)**

A large language model is an advanced type of language model that is
trained using deep learning techniques on massive amounts of text data.
These models are capable of generating human-like text and performing
various natural language processing tasks.

The term \"Large\" refers to that, LLMs are trained on vast amounts of
data. This size is crucial because it lets them understand complex
language patterns better. The term "Language models" are essentially
algorithms or systems that are trained to understand and generate
human-like text. They serve as a representation of how language works,
learning from diverse datasets to predict what words or sequences of
words are likely to come next in a given context.

LLMs can perform many types of language tasks, such as translating
languages, analyzing sentiments, chatbot conversations, and more. They
can understand complex textual data, identify entities and relationships
between them, and generate new text that is coherent and grammatically
accurate. Popular LLMs are GPT-3, Gemini, Claude, etc

Older language models were smaller and couldn\'t grasp language
complexities as well. But with advancements in technology and powerful
computers, we can built much larger models like ChatGPT. These LLMs,
with billions of parameters, excel at understanding and generating
language.

# **How do LLMs Work?**

LLMs work through a combination of machine learning and deep learning
techniques. Machine learning involves training a program with large
datasets to recognize patterns without human help. LLMs use deep
learning, a type of machine learning where programs learn to recognize
patterns on their own, although some human adjustment is usually needed.

Deep learning uses probability to learn. A deep learning model cannot
actually conclude anything from a single sentence. But after analyzing
trillions of sentences, it could learn enough to predict how to
logically finish an incomplete sentence, or even generate its own
sentences.LLMs are built on neural networks, like the human brain. These networks
are made of interconnected nodes that communicate with each other. They
have layers, including an input and output layer, and they pass
information when their outputs reach a certain level.

The specific kind of neural networks used for LLMs are called
transformer models. Transformer models are able to learn context ---
especially important for human language, which is highly
context-dependent. Transformer models use a mathematical technique
called self-attention to detect subtle ways that elements in a sequence
relate to each other. This makes them better at understanding context
than other types of machine learning. It enables them to understand, for
instance, how the end of a sentence connects to the beginning, and how
the sentences in a paragraph relate to each other.

This enables LLMs to interpret human language, even when that language
is vague or poorly defined, arranged in combinations they have not
encountered before, or contextualized in new ways. On some level they
\"understand\" semantics in that they can associate words and concepts
by their meaning, having seen them grouped together in that way millions
or billions of times.

Techniques like prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning with human feedback can improve their performance and help
remove biases and errors. It\'s crucial to ensure LLMs are reliable and
don\'t produce harmful content, which can be achieved through careful
training and monitoring.

## **Training LLMs**

Training LLMs is a complex process, it involves instructing the model to
comprehend and produce human-like text. Simplified steps of working of LLMs

## **1.Providing Input Text:**

-   LLMs start by reading lots of text from books, articles, and
    websites.

-   During training, they learn to predict the next word in a sentence
    based on what they\'ve read.

-   It learns patterns and relationships within the text data.

## **2.Optimizing Model Weights:**

-   LLMs have different \"weights\" for their parameters, which
    determine the importance of various features.

-   Throughout training, these weights are adjusted to minimize
    mistakes, making the model better at guessing the next word.

## **3.Fine-tuning Parameter Values:**

-   LLMs continuously adjust parameter values based on error feedback
    received during predictions.

-   This iterative process helps them get better at understanding
    language and making accurate guesses about what comes next.

This training process vary based on type of LLM being developed. Performance of LLM depend on two things.

1.  **Model Design:** This is all about how the LLM is put together. The
    fancier and more detailed it is, the better it can understand subtle
    parts of language.

2.  **Data Quality:** The stuff the LLM learns from matters a lot. If it
    reads a wide range of good-quality text, it\'ll understand language
    better than if it only sees a small amount of less useful text.

Training an LLM takes a lot of computer power. It can take days or even
weeks, depending on how complex the model is and how much data it\'s
trained on. Usually, powerful computers and specialized hardware like
high-performance GPUs are used to speed up the process. Once trained, LLMs can be customized for different tasks using smaller
sets of supervised data, a process called fine-tuning.

There are three common learning methods:

-   **Zero-shot learning:** The base LLM can handle various tasks
    without extra training, often by giving it prompts. But the accuracy
    may vary.

-   **Few-shot learning:** Giving the base model a few relevant examples
    improves its performance in a particular area.

-   **Domain Adaptation:** This is like few-shot learning, but with more
    data related to a specific application or field.
